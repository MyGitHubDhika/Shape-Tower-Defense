This is a simple, BattleCats inspired game about Shape Tower Defense. You are controlling the ball and the enemies are the squares.

This games is primarily for learning about Godot since it was my first game on this engine.

Current progress: 
- Coins system (75%), the enemies still haven't dropped any coins.
